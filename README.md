# countries-and-weather-demo  
Welcome to my application, which allows you to search for information about any country in the world. With my app, you can find basic information about a country, such as its population, language, and currency, as well as the current weather in its capital city.

My application is built using a Node.js backend with Express and Axios for API requests, and a frontend built with React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The app is responsive and can be used on both desktop and mobile devices.

To use my app, simply enter the name of the country you're interested in, and my app will retrieve the necessary information from two different RESTful APIs. First, I fetch basic information about the country, such as its name, flag, population, and language, from one API. Then, I retrieve the current weather information for the capital city of the country from a second API.

Thank you for using my application, and I hope you find the information you are looking for!
